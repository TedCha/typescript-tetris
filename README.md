# TypeScript Tetris

## References
This project was inspired by a [tutorial created by Meth Meth Method](https://youtu.be/H2aW5V46khA).

## About
The tutorial by Meth Meth Method covered creating Tetris in the browser using JavaScript, while building I converted the code to TypeScript, optimized confusing code, and created some of my own stylings.

## Installation

To install and test the project on your local machine, clone the GitHub repo with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tcharts-boop/typescript-tetris.git
```

Then build the project using the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

From there, open the index.html file via a local web server and you can start playing Tetris!
